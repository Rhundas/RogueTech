    "Details": "\"Hey, Commander!\" A shout from down the hallway catches your attention as you leave the MechBay. Throwing a glance to your left you see [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] jogging towards you.\n\n\"{TGT_MW.LastName},\" you say, quirking a brow at {TGT_MW.Det} excited grin, \"what's the rush?\"\n\n{TGT_MW.Callsign} all but shoves a datapad into your hands. Looking down at it you can see a full [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreTRO],TRO]] for a BattleMech.\n\n\"I saw we have a <i>Crab</i> 27b in storage,\" {TGT_MW.Subj} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:explain|Default:explains}, catching {TGT_MW.Det} breath. \"If we're not planning to use it, I reckon I can build it up to that specification.\"\n\nParsing through the TRO, several unsual additions catch your eye — unusual and expensive additions. Your quirked brow quirks higher as you crunch the numbers in your head.\n\nAs if sensing your feat of mental gymnastics, {TGT_MW.Callsign} speaks up again. \"Look! I know it's a big ask, but this 'Mech is a design that's seen me through thick, thin, and everything in between! She was, admittedly, completely destroyed a while back, but I can rebuild her better than ever with the <i>Argo's</i> MechBays and two weeks — tops!\"\n\nBy now, the commotion has attracted the attention of Yang. He hovers beside you and silently holds out a hand for the datapad, which you pass over. Both you and {TGT_MW.Callsign} wait while Yang reads through the TRO. After a short couple of minutes, he looks back up, hands the datapad back to {TGT_MW.Callsign}. \"Yeah,\" he says, \"it's certainly <i>possible</i>-\"\n\n\"Yes!\" {TGT_MW.Callsign} celebrates. Yang clears his throat.\n\n\"<i>But</i>,\" he continues, \"it'll be expensive and it'll divert a not-insignificant amount of our workforce until it's done. It's your call, Commander.\"",
