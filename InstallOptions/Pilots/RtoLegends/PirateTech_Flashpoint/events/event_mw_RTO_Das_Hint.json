Turning the last twist before the doorway puts you face to face with [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]], who looks just as surprised as you do. After an awkward, but thankfully brief stand off {TGT_MW.Subj} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:break|Default:breaks} the silence.\n\n\"Commander. Hi,\" {TGT_MW.Subj} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:begin|Default:begins}, \"I've ... been around for a while, y'know. In the company, I mean. Taken some knocks, had a few laughs, et cetera. I was wondering if — well, I could ask for a favour. Sort of.\"\n\nYou raise a brow. \"Sort of? What's on your mind, {TGT_MW.LastName}?\"\n\n\"There's a 'Mech that I used to pilot,\" {TGT_MW.Subj} {TGT_MW.Gender?NonBinary:explain|Default:explains}, leaning against the metal wall of the hallway. \"A long time ago now, but it was a custom ride I fixed up myself. I've been poking around the Mech Bay - maybe a bit more than I should've been, but ... I think with the right chassis and the <i>Argo's</i> facilities I could rebuild that 'Mech. I think it'd be a great addition to the company.\"\n\nIntrigued, you fold your arms and park on the opposite wall. \"That depends on what the chassis is. Tell me what you need and I'll tell you if we can make it happen.\"\n\n{TGT_MW.Callsign} grins confidently. \"An [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[SLDF],SLDF]] 'Mech — a <i>Crab</i> 27b. It'd need to be stripped down completely. Having it be in cold storage would make it easier, even.\"",
